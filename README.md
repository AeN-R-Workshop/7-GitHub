# Template
Template repository for the Nansen Legacy R workshop: GitHub session.

Below, you can find instructions on what each participant has to do in this session.

Part 1: Working on your own repository

  1. Create your own repository

  2. Clone the respository so you can work on it on your local computer

  3. Create a basic text file in the repository.

  4. 'Add' the changes you have made in the repo to the staging area.

  5. Commit these changes, with a suitable message
  
  6. Push these changes to the origin on GitHub
  
  7. Pull the local repository. This pulls any changes that may have been made to the repository. 
  
  *This isn't neccessary in this case as you know that you are the only person working on your respository, but it is a good habit to pull after your have pushed. 
  
  8. Create a new branch for testing. This is good practice when you don't want to make changes to the main branch.
  
  
  
  OR IN ONE LINE
  
  
  9. Add some changes to your repository. You can create a new file or change existing files.
  
  10. Add and commit your changes.
  
  11. Checkout the main branch again. Merge your test branch with the main branch.
  
  12. Push your changes.
  
  13. Repeat steps 7 to 12 until you feel comfortable with this process.
  
 
Part 2: Working together on a repository

  1. Creator of respository: Add someone else to your repository so that they can also make changes.
  
  2. Collaborator: Clone the repository so you can work on it on your local computer.
  
  3. Collaborator: Create a new branch, make some changes, add and commit (steps 8 to 10 in part 1). DO NOT MERGE.
  
  4. Collaborator: Push these changes to the origin
  
  5. Collaborator: Navigate to the repository online on GitHub
  
  6. Collaborator: Submit a pull request
  
  7. Creator of repository: Depending on your account setup, you may have received an email regarding this pull request. Go to your repo on GitHub. You can now review it and, if you choose to, accept the changes and merge them with the main branch. This can all be done on the GitHub page.
  
  
Part 3: Suggesting changes to someone else's repository.

To avoid confusion, please don't start this part until you are certain that the person whose repository you are forking has also completed part 2 step 7.

  1. Fork the repository to your personal page. This creates a copy of the repository.
  
  2. Clone this forked repository so you can work on it locally.
  
  3. Create a branch, make changes, add, commit.
  
  4. Push these changes to your forked repository online
  
  5. Submit a pull request. Here, you are requesting that the changes you have made on your forked repository should be pulled into the original project.
  
  6. Creator of repository: Review the pull request as in part 2 step 7.
